title: Rails & Sequent
---

This guide gives a step by step overview on how to add Sequent to an existing Rails application.

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL database. Sequent only supports Postgres databases. There is no particular reason for this other than that we haven't had the need or time
to support any other databases.

## Guide assumptions

You are already familiar with Ruby on Rails and the core [Concepts](concepts.html) of Sequent.

For a seamless integration with the latest Rails, best is to adhere to the Rails naming conventions. In Rails everything under the `app` directory is autoloaded.
To make use of this feature, best is to put your domain classes under an `app` subdirectory. For instance in `app/domain/bank_account/bank_account_aggregate.rb`.
In this case Rails expects your domain class to be called `BankAccount::BankAccountAggregate`.
See the [Rails autoloading and reloading guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html){:target="_blank"} for more details.

1) Add to your `Gemfile`

   ```
   gem 'sequent', git: 'https://github.com/zilverline/sequent'
   ```

2) Run `bundle install`

3) Copy the `sequent_schema.rb` file from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zilverline/sequent/master/db/sequent_schema.rb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zilverline/sequent/master/db/sequent_schema.rb){:target="_blank"} and put it in your `./db` directory.

4) Create `./db/sequent_migrations.rb`. This will contain your `view_schema` migrations. 
    
 ```ruby
 VIEW_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1
 
 class SequentMigrations < Sequent::Migrations::Projectors
   def self.version
     VIEW_SCHEMA_VERSION
   end
 
   def self.versions
     {
       '1' => [
         # List of migrations for version 1
       ],
     }
   end
 end
 ```

    For a complete overview on how Migrations work in Sequent, check out the [Migrations Guide](/docs/concepts/migrations.html)
   
  
5) Add the following snippet to your `Rakefile`

 ```ruby
 # Sequent requires a `SEQUENT_ENV` environment to be set
 # next to a `RAILS_ENV` 
 ENV['SEQUENT_ENV'] = ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'development'
 
 require 'sequent/rake/migration_tasks'
 
 Sequent::Rake::MigrationTasks.new.register_tasks!
 
 # The dependency of sequent:init on :environment ensures the Rails app is loaded
 # when running the sequent migrations. This is needed otherwise
 # the sequent initializer - which is required to run these rake tasks -
 # doesn't run
 task 'sequent:init' => [:environment]
 task 'sequent:migrate:init' => [:sequent_db_connect]
 
 task 'sequent_db_connect' do
   Sequent::Support::Database.connect!(ENV['SEQUENT_ENV'])
 end

 # Create custom rake task setting the SEQUENT_MIGRATION_SCHEMAS for
 # running the Rails migrations 
 task :migrate_public_schema do
   ENV['SEQUENT_MIGRATION_SCHEMAS'] = 'public'
   Rake::Task['db:migrate'].invoke
   ENV['SEQUENT_MIGRATION_SCHEMAS'] = nil
 end

 # Prevent rails db:migrate from being executed directly.
 Rake::Task['db:migrate'].enhance([:'sequent:db:dont_use_db_migrate_directly'])
 ```


 **You can't use rails db:migrate directly** anymore since  
 that will add all the tables of the `view_schema` and `sequent_schema`
 to the `schema.rb` file after running a Rails migration. To fix this
 the `rails db:migrate` must be wrapped in your own task setting the
 environment variable `SEQUENT_MIGRATION_SCHEMAS`.
 For safety reasons you can enchance and prepend the `rails db:migrate`
 with Sequents `sequent:db:dont_use_db_migrate_directly` Rake task
 so running it without `SEQUENT_MIGRATION_SCHEMAS` set will fail.
 {: .notice--warning}

6) Ensure your `database.yml` contains the schema_search_path: 

 ```yaml
 default:
   schema_search_path: <%= ENV['SEQUENT_MIGRATION_SCHEMAS'] || 'public, sequent_schema, view_schema' %>
 ```

7) Enable eager loading on all environments

   Sequent internally relies on registries of classes of certain types. For instance it keeps track of all
   `AggregateRoot` classes by adding them to a registry when `Sequent::Core::AggregateRoot` is extended.
   For this to work properly, all classes must be eager loaded otherwise code depending on this fact might
   produce unpredictable results. Set the `config.eager_load` to `true` for all environments 
   (in production the Rails default is already `true`).

8) Add `./config/initializers/sequent.rb` containing at least:

 ```ruby
 require_relative '../../db/sequent_migrations'

 Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare do
   Sequent.configure do |config|
     config.migrations_class_name = 'SequentMigrations'
     config.enable_autoregistration = true
     config.event_store_cache_event_types = !Rails.env.development?

     config.database_config_directory = 'config'
   
     # this is the location of your sql files for your view_schema
     config.migration_sql_files_directory = 'db/sequent'
   end
 end
 ```

**You must** wrap the sequent initializer code in `Rails.application.reloader.to_prepare` because during
initialization, the autoloading hasn't run yet.
{: .notice--warning}

9) Run the following commands to create the `sequent_schema` and `view_schema`  

 ```bash
 bundle exec rake sequent:db:create_event_store
 bundle exec rake sequent:db:create_view_schema
 
 # only run this when you add or change projectors in SequentMigrations
 bundle exec rake sequent:migrate:online
 bundle exec rake sequent:migrate:offline    
 ```

10) Add the following to application.rb

   This step is actually only necessary if you load Aggregates outside the scope
   of the Unit Of Work which is automatically started and committed via the `execute_commands` call. 
   If you for instance load Aggregates inside Controllers or or ActiveJob you have to clear Sequent's Unit Of Work (stored in the Thread.current) yourself.
   For the web you can add the following Rack middleware:

```ruby
config.middleware.use Sequent::Util::Web::ClearCache
```

   Otherwise you will need to add a call to `Sequent.aggregate_repository.clear!` somewhere yourself.

   See using the [AggregateRepository outside the Unit Of Work](concepts/aggregate-repository.html#advanced-usage-outside-the-commandservice-transaction) for more details.

11) Run `rails s`


### Where to put your domain classes

Rails uses [Zeitwerk](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk){:target="_blank"} for autoloading and reloading. To ensure your domain classes will also benefit from
this feature, put them under a subdirectory of the `app` folder and adhere to the Rails naming conventions.

One caveat is that this leads to an explosion of small files containing singular `Event`s and `Command`s.
The preference of the Sequent team is to group all `Event`s and `Command`s in a single file (e.g. `events|commands.rb`).
Luckily in Zeitwerk this is still possible. An example folder structure:

```
app/
  controllers/
  models/
  domain/ # <- you can pick any name
    banking/ # <- optional subdirectory
      bank_account.rb
      events.rb
      command_handler.rb
```

In the above example the `bank_account.rb` contains the `AggregateRoot` and looks as follows:

```ruby
module Banking # <- corresponds to the subdirectory banking
   class BankAccount < Sequent::AggregateRoot
   end
end
```

The `events.rb` file:

```ruby
module Banking
   module Events # <- because our file is called `events.rb` it expects a module Events to exist.
      class BankAccountCreated < Sequent::Event; end
      class BankAccountClosed < Sequent::Event; end
   end
end
```

The "downside" here is that you need to introduce an extra layer of naming to be able to group your events into a single file. 

### Rails Engines

Sequent in [Rails Engines](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html){:target="_blank"} work basically the same as a normal Rails application.
Some things to remember when working with Rails Engines:

1. The Sequent config must be set in the main application `config/initializers`
2. The main application is the maintainer of the `sequent_schema` and `view_schema`. 
   So copy over the migration sql files to the main application directory like you would when an Engine provides active record migrations.
